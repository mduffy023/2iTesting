This is the 2iTesting Programming Repository

I have completed the coding challenge using C#.
IDE used was Visual Studio 
Looking at the challenge I made the choice of pre setting the array with 10 intergers. 
added depication as the challeged requried me o remove any number that where the same.
I put the list in a unorder display to show how it origial looked. then went through the process of remove the dupes and sorting the array 
I then finally revesed the array from highest to lowest value
